                    <p><i>“doc_lag1: have ancients been to the moon :thonk:" </i></p>
                    <p>this one is interesting and I have NO idea. The ancients are in some ways behind contemporary humans and in many ways waaaay ahead, so it's not really possible to know! Interesting question though</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><i>"Question: How many iterators were in Moons local group?" </i></p>
                    <p>from the pearls it seems like there were at least a few, right?</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><i>"Hello, if Scavengers visit Moon's chamber in canon, how come in the (outdated) PC version, Moon's chamber is forbidden for Scavs to enter?"</i></p>
                    <p>lol the info you get over by hacking the game isn't canon hahaha</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><i>“@RainWorld is survivor an adult when the game starts (when the slugcat can be controlled etc)”</i></p>
                    <p>Hmm it's definitely older than in the intro sequence that's for sure! If you look at Iggy's projection images and compare it seems like it's at least very close to full grown if you full grown outright</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><i>"zangerinetangerine: hey devs do you think daddy long leg tentacles have the same stickiness and texture of those sticky hands you slap on a wall?"</i></p>
                    <p>Yes</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><i> "ehsper02: Question: Based on the unused assets like distantghost or tracks like upperwall, how much darker/sadder was the game originally going to be?"</i></p>
                    <p>Interesting one! I think the game baaaasically kept to the same emotional tone throughout development, but it also of course had to adapt as the project grew. Maybe the very very first original vision was a little bit more myspace emo than the final game ended up being</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><i>"EmpathyModule: concept art more like canon art"</i></p>
                    <p>lol not really. Basically all creatures changed a lot between sketches and implementation and it's def the implementations versions that count</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><i>(I assume the question asked was about the crew's favorite lizards.)</i></p>
                    <p>lydia: @slugcatsarecute I like the white lizards best</p>
                    <p>miimows: @slugcatsarecute its so hard to choose but i love cyans</p>
                    <p>jamesprimate: @im all about the yelows</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><i>"Twitch Primeprehistoricbanana: question how the hell did the ancients manage to skip over so many basic developments like WHEELS but also have giant sentient supercomputers that can keep themselves alive with no maintenance"</i></p>
                    <p>Ancients would ask you how you could come up with something so extreme as wheels without going through the natural steps of first inventing karmic trance coupling sequences</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><i>inkymagpie: @RainWorld Are Seven Red Suns,Chasing wind and unparalleled innocence still alive</i></p>
                    <p>@inkymagpie we try to keep in ambiguous, but i think so? its a large world</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>miimows: the clap from moon's neurons keeps alerting the iterators</p>
                    <p>miimows: moon is dummy thicc</p>
                    <p><i>Applebread: dude miimows, I made that joke earlier today, were you lurking</i></p>
                    <p>miimows: @Applebread ahaha i was at work all day but she's undisputedly dummy thicc</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><i>"DerethZZ: @RainWorld RW may be an alien world, but why are hazer squids so incredibly earth-like? they look a bit much like earth squids, and i can kinda say the same for coalescipede spiders"</i></p>
                    <p>jamesprimate: @DerethZZ we can only be so creative T___T</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><i>"TheMatten: NSH is definitely a chad"</i></p>
                    <p>jamesprimate: NSH is definitely a chad though,that transcends</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><i>"Twelve_Havens: will we at least get a playable lingo build ever"</i></p>
                    <p>jamesprimate: @Twelve_Havens you want even MORE broken experience??</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><i>"Dan64Z: @RainWorld Did you ever concidered another name for the game or had difficulty naming it?"</i></p>
                    <p>joar_lj: actually yeah! It got the name early on but then there was this period of doubt, I'm sure it can be found somewhere deep in TIGs still. But then we went back to the old name</p>
                    <p>jamesprimate: @Dan64Z early early on it was called maze runner!</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>jamesprimate: @Dan64Z thankfully we changed that, because there was that whole movie series lmao</p>
                    <p><i>"inkymagpie: @RainWorld If moon is Pebbles closest who else is there. Like is it true innocence is the second one closest to him? would that make NSH the third? Who would the fourth be,Sun or Wind"</i></p>
                    <p>jamesprimate: @inkymagpie pretty sure NSH is, but probably some FAN will dunk on me and prove it was someone else</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><i>"Dan64Z: @RainWorld Did iterators have memes? :eyes:"</i></p>
                    <p>joar_lj: I'd say yes, but their meming stagnated in like 2008 rage comics for centuries</p>
                    <p>miimows: i bet pebbles sends outdated memes to the other iterators</p>
                    <p>Applebread: pebbles still laughs at ugandan knuckles memes and fidget spinners</p>
                    <p>Moderatormiimows: pebbles is a fidget spinner</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><i>"cleverpidgeon: pebbles says that the farm arrays is to the west (left) but that moon is to the south, despite her being to the right. is that a representation of 3d space within a 2d game?"</i></p>

            <p>joar_lj: use the speed of sound in the audio engine</p>
            <p>joar_lj: "TheMatten: But what if the physics of sound are different in Rain World's universe" super valid</p>

            <p><i>"EmpathyModule: If this is just going to be a dev chat stream, why was it marked as '???' on the stream schedule?"</i></p>

            <p><i>"zangerinetangerine: hey is there a real/lore related reason why lizards dont ascend? or is it just because of the game"</i></p>

            <br>
            <p><i>"zangerinetangerine: another question: which is smarter, vultures or lizards?"</i></p>
            <p>jamesprimate: @zangerinetangerine people have theories about vulture culture etc., so id say them! lizards are just lizards i suppose</p>
            <br>
            <p><i>"HoukouNRL: @RainWorld was there a creature you guys designed but never got to implementing at all?"</i></p>

            <p><i>"DevotedlyDragonesque: tell us about the forbidden cut creatures"</i></p>
            <p>jamesprimate: @DevotedlyDragonesque we had some wild ones. kind of cosmic level stuff, taking over areas of the world little by little</p>
            <br>
            <p><i>"Axolittl: did you make cyans with taming in mind?"</i></p>
            <p>joar_lj: Nope!</p>
            <br>
            <p><i>"cleverpidgeon: is there any in-universe way to reconcile the blue fruit being pupas with them adding to the Monk passage or is that just a game mechanic kinda thing?"</i></p>
            <p>joar_lj: this is a theological problem and you'd have to turn to the old scrolls</p>
            <br>
            <p><i>"snailturtle7: is rain world in every way what you wanted it to be?"</i></p>
            <p>jamesprimate: @snailturtle7 very much yes? theres lots of little things here and there, but i thin the end result is basically exactly as we wanted</p>

            <p><i>"EmpathyModule: is there a nega-void above RW that spits stuff out instead of erasing it and does it put you back a previous life instead of ascending you"</i></p>
            <p>jamesprimate: @EmpathyModule that was an idea!</p>
            <p>jamesprimate: joar had a pretty in depth cosmology</p>
            <br>
            <p><i>"Sudowoodude: @joar_lj @jamesprimate Can you elaborate on the various philosophical movements Iterators have come up with? The stuff like ''fringe Regeneraist reasearch'' that's mentioned in the lore seems like it'd be interesting to go more in-depth into."</i></p>
            <p>joar_lj: the iterators are super smart, their brains are like the size of skyscrapers. No idea what they are up to other than it being needlessly convoluted</p>

            <p>joar_lj: @Enderzilla101 uh the respawning and how it relates to canon is intentionally left a bit vague</p>
